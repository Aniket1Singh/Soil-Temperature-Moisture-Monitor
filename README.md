# Soil-Temperature-Moisture-Monitor
This project implements a Soil Temperature and Moisture Monitoring System using an Arduino Uno. The system utilizes an analog temperature sensor to measure soil temperature and a soil moisture sensor to assess moisture levels. The gathered data is used to activate visual indicators based on predefined temperature thresholds.
